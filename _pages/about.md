I'm a third year PhD student from [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Jufeng Yang](https://cv.nankai.edu.cn/) of Computer Vision Lab. Before that, I received my bachelorâ€™s degree from [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2021.


My research interests include computer vision and deep learning, particularly focusing on **video understanding** and **video-language multimodal learning**. The main objective of my research is to enable machines to understand high-level instances as humans, including cognitive emotion and geometric primitive. You can find my CV here: [Zhicheng Zhang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/pdf/NKU_zzc_CV_nounderreview.pdf) and [Webpage](/cv/).


For our works, we provide interesting [demos](/projects/) for fun. Some examples are listed and you can also upload yours. Moreover, please feel free to make any suggestions. You can contact with me in following ways:
