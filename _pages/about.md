I'm a second year PhD student from [School of CS](https://cc.nankai.edu.cn/), [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jufeng Yang](https://cv.nankai.edu.cn/) of Computer Vision Lab from Nankai University.


My research interests include computer vision and deep learning, particularly focusing on **video understanding** and **video-language multimodal learning**. You can find my CV here: [Zhicheng Zhang's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/NKU_zzc_CV.pdf).



For our works, we provide some interesting demos for fun. Some videos are presented and you can also upload yours. Moreover, please feel free to make any suggestions. You can contact with me in following ways:
