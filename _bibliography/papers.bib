  abstract  = {Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) recently showed strong capacity in integrating data among multiple modalities, empowered by a generalizable attention architecture. Advanced methods predominantly focus on language-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through attention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained cognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention deficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent cross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To address this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex Attention (\model), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and inter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to effectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the alignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis vectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality. Further, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked attention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable masking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21 benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition, and emotion tasks.},

  abstract  = {Video prediction is a challenging task due to its nature of uncertainty, especially for forecasting a long period. To model the temporal dynamics, advanced methods benefit from the recent success of diffusion models, and repeatedly refine the predicted future frames with 3D spatiotemporal U-Net. However, there exists a gap between the present and future and the repeated usage of U-Net brings a heavy computation burden. To address this, we propose a diffusion-based video prediction method that predicts future frames by extrapolating the present distribution of features, namely ExtDM. Specifically, our method consists of three components: (i) a motion autoencoder conducts a bijection transformation between video frames and motion cues; (ii) a layered distribution adaptor module extrapolates the present features in the guidance of Gaussian distribution; (iii) a 3D U-Net architecture specialized for jointly fusing guidance and features among the temporal dimension by spatiotemporal-window attention. Extensive experiments on four popular benchmarks covering short- and long-term video prediction verify the effectiveness of ExtDM.},

  year      = {2024},
  abstract  = {Limited training data is a long-standing problem for video emotion analysis (VEA). Existing works leverage the power of large-scale image datasets for transferring while failing to extract the temporal correlation of affective cues in the video. Inspired by psychology research and empirical theory, we verify that the degree of emotion may vary in different segments of the video, thus introducing the sentiment complementary and emotion intrinsic among temporal segments. Motivated by this, we propose an MAE-style method for learning robust affective representation of videos via masking, termed MART. The method is comprised of emotional lexicon extraction and masked emotion recovery. First, we extract the affective cues of the lexicon and verify the extracted one by computing its matching score with video content. The hierarchical verification strategy is proposed, in terms of sentiment and emotion, to identify the matched cues alongside the temporal dimension. Then, with the verified cues, we propose masked affective modeling to recover temporal emotion distribution. We present temporal affective complementary learning that pulls the complementary part and pushes the intrinsic part of masked multimodal features, for learning robust affective representation. Under the constraint of affective complementary, we leverage cross-modal attention among features to mask the video and recover the degree of emotion among segments. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in video sentiment analysis, video emotion recognition, multimodal sentiment analysis, and multimodal emotion recognition.},

  abstract  = {Camouflaged vision perception is an important vision task with numerous practical applications. Due to the expensive collection and labeling costs, this community struggles with a major bottleneck that the species category of its datasets is limited to a small number of object species. However, the existing camouflaged generation methods require specifying the background manually, thus failing to extend the camouflaged sample diversity in a low-cost manner. In this paper, we propose a Latent Background Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion (LAKE-RED) for camouflaged image generation. To our knowledge, our contributions mainly include: (1) For the first time, we propose a camouflaged generation paradigm that does not need to receive any background inputs. (2) Our LAKE-RED is the first knowledge retrieval-augmented method with interpretability for camouflaged generation, in which we propose an idea that knowledge retrieval and reasoning enhancement are separated explicitly, to alleviate the task-specific challenges. Moreover, our method is not restricted to specific foreground targets or backgrounds, offering a potential for extending camouflaged vision perception to more diverse domains. (3) Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing approaches, generating more realistic camouflage images.},

  abstract={Machines extract human-understandable information from the environment via adaptive perception to build intelligent system in open-world scenarios. Derived from the class-agnostic characteristics of attribute knowledge, attribution-guided perception methods and models are established and widely studied. In this paper, the tasks involved in attribution-guided adaptive visual perception and structure understanding are firstly introduced, and their applicable scenarios are analyzed. The representative research on four key aspects is summarized. Basic visual attribute knowledge extraction methods cover low-level geometric attributes and high-level cognitive attributes. Attribute knowledge-guided weakly-supervised visual perception includes weakly supervised learning and unsupervised learning under data label restrictions. Image self-supervised learning covers self-supervise contrastive learning and unsupervised commonality learning. Structured representation and understanding of scene images and their applications are introduced as well. Finally, challenges and potential research directions are discussed, such as the construction of large-scale benchmark datasets with multiple attributes, multi-modal attribute knowledge extraction, scene generalization of attribute knowledge perception models, the
  development of lightweight attribute knowledge-guided models and the practical applications of scene image representation},

  abstract  = {Tracking both location and pose of multiple planar objects (MPOT) is of great significance to numerous real-world applications. The greater degree-of-freedom of planar objects compared with common objects makes MPOT far more challenging than well-studied object tracking, especially when occlusion occurs. To address this challenging task, we are inspired by amodal perception that humans jointly track visible and invisible parts of the target, and propose a tracking framework that unifies appearance perception and occlusion reasoning. Specifically, we present a dual branch network to track the visible part of planar objects, including vertexes and mask. Then, we develop an occlusion area localization strategy to infer the invisible part, i.e., the occluded region, followed by a two-stream attention network finally refining the prediction. To alleviate the lack of data in this field, we build the first large-scale benchmark dataset, namely MPOT-3K. It consists of 3,717 planar objects from 356 videos, and contains 148,896 frames together with 687,417 annotations. The collected planar objects have 9 motion patterns and the videos are shot in 6 types of indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method on the newly developed MPOT-3K as well as other two popular single planar object tracking datasets.},

  abstract={Automatically predicting the emotions of user-generated videos (UGVs) receives increasing interest recently. However, existing methods mainly focus on a few key visual frames, which may limit their capacity to encode the context that depicts the intended emotions. To tackle that, in this paper, we propose a cross-modal temporal erasing network that locates not only keyframes but also context and audio-related information in a weakly-supervised manner. In specific, we first leverage the intra- and inter-modal relationship among different segments to accurately select keyframes. Then, we iteratively erase keyframes to encourage the model to concentrate on the contexts that include complementary information. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract={Existing methods in planar region segmentation suffer the problems of vague boundaries and failure to detect small-sized regions. To address these, this study presents an end-to-end framework, named PlaneSeg, which can be easily integrated into various plane segmentation models. Specifically, PlaneSeg contains three modules, namely the edge feature extraction module, the multi-scale module, and the resolution-adaptation module. First, the edge feature extraction module produces edge-aware feature maps for finer segmentation boundaries. The learned edge information acts as a constraint to mitigate inaccurate boundaries. Second, the multi-scale module combines feature maps of different layers to harvest spatial and semantic information from planar objects. The multiformity of object information can help recognize small-sized objects to produce more accurate segmentation results. Third, the resolution-adaptation module fuses the feature maps produced by the two aforementioned modules. For this module, a pair-wise feature fusion is adopted to resample the dropped pixels and extract more detailed features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PlaneSeg outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on three downstream tasks, including plane segmentation, 3D plane reconstruction, and depth prediction.},

  abstract = {Video sentiment analysis aims to uncover the underlying attitudes of viewers, which has a wide range of applications in real world. Existing works simply classify a video into a single sentimental category, ignoring the fact that sentiment in untrimmed videos may appear in multiple segments with varying lengths and unknown locations. To address this, we propose a challenging task, i.e., Temporal Sentiment Localization (TSL), to find which parts of the video convey sentiment. To systematically investigate fully- and weakly-supervised settings for TSL, we first build a benchmark dataset named TSL-300, which is consisting of 300 videos with a total length of 1,291 minutes. Each video is labeled in two ways, one of which is frame-by-frame annotation for the fully-supervised setting, and the other is single-frame annotation, i.e., only a single frame with strong sentiment is labeled per segment for the weakly-supervised setting. Due to the high cost of labeling a densely annotated dataset, we propose TSL-Net in this work, employing single-frame supervision to localize sentiment in videos. In detail, we generate the pseudo labels for unlabeled frames using a greedy search strategy, and fuse the affective features of both visual and audio modalities to predict the temporal sentiment distribution. Here, a reverse mapping strategy is designed for feature fusion, and a contrastive loss is utilized to maintain the consistency between the original feature and the reverse prediction. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method against the state-of-the-art approaches.},
